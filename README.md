b'**Open Access: The Effect of Neurorehabilitation on Multiple Sclerosis \xe2\x80\x93 Unlocking the Resting-State fMRI Data**\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nWe publish fMRI data of 60 people with Multiple Sclerosis before and after two months of neuroproprioceptive "facilitation and inhibition" treatment. \r\n\r\n**For more details on the original study design as well as the acquisition parameters, please consult our [Data Report][1]**\r\n\r\nThe data contain the following information:\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**clinical.csv**\r\n \r\n Clinical information about subjects. \r\n \r\n - **ID**: subject identifier. \r\n - **SEX**: "M" or "F" identifying males and females.\r\n - **MS_TYPE**: type of multiple sclerosis either "remitting_relapsing", "primary_progressive" or "secondary progressive".\r\n - **AGE**: age at the time of the study.\r\n - **EDSS**: Expanded Disability Status Scale at the time of the study. \r\n - **DATASET**: whether the subject was a part of the pilot or the consecutive project (is relevant because of the slight change in the fMRI acquisition parameters).\r\n - **DIAG_YEARS**: number of years since diagnosis.\r\n - **BMI**: BMI at the time of the study.\r\n - **THERAPY**: type of rehabilitation (see [Prochazkova et al 2020][2]).\r\n - **outliers_V1**: the absolute number of volumes flagged as outliers participant\'s first visit ([step 3][3] of the CONN pipeline).\r\n - **outliers_V2**: the absolute number of volumes flagged as outliers participant\'s second visit ([step 3][3] of the CONN pipeline).\r\n----------\r\n**nifti**\r\n\r\nThe directory contains [CONN][4] preprocessed fMRI time-series. Each subject was recorded twice - before and after neuroproprioceptive "facilitation and inhibition" treatment. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n**quality measures**\r\n\r\nContains files with the appropriate displacement measures for each subject and visit.\r\n - **DVARS.csv** \r\n - **FD.csv**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**FC**\r\n\r\nContains functional connectivity matrices as **.csv* for each subject and visit.\r\nAlso contains file **AAL_labels.csv** with labels of AAL atlas regions.\r\n\r\n----------\r\nFor more work of our **COBRA** group, please visit our [website][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.662784/full\r\n  [2]: https://journals.lww.com/intjrehabilres/Abstract/2015/03000/Motor_programme_activating_therapy_influences.6.aspx\r\n  [3]: https://web.conn-toolbox.org/home\r\n  [4]: https://web.conn-toolbox.org/fmri-methods/preprocessing-pipeline\r\n  [5]: http://cobra.cs.cas.cz/'

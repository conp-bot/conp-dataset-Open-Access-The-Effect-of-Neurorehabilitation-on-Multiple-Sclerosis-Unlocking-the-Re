  "title": "The Effect of Neurorehabilitation on Multiple Sclerosis",
  "description": "Multiple sclerosis is a severe neurodegenerative condition that significantly affects motor and cognitive performance of patients. However, the mechanisms of the disease are not yet fully understood. It has been hypothesized that regular neurorehabilitation may stimulate the brain plasticity mechanisms and thus slow the progression of the disease. Indeed, studies reported evidence of the positive effect of neurorehabilitation on functional reorganization. However, the research is currently limited to mostly small datasets, which raises concerns about wider interpretation and generalization of the results. We aim to support this research by sharing the resting-state fMRI time-series of sixty multiple sclerosis patients before and after neurorehabilitation treatment. fMRI is a well-established modality in studying neurological conditions allowing for a broad spectrum of analytical approaches and, therefore, beneficial for a wider scientific community. We believe the publication of this data will promote research and improve the reproducibility of any future reports.",
